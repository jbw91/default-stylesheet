# Default Stylesheet

A beautifully simple default CSS stylesheet

## Getting Started

Using Default Stylesheet is simple. Documentation for usage is located at [http://jbw91.github.io/default-stylesheet/](http://jbw91.github.io/default-stylesheet/). You can add it to your project one of two ways.

### Using Bower

Simply install in by running:

```
bower install --save default-stylesheet
```

### Downloading

If you're not using bower, simply download the file (located in the dist folder, called barebones-grid.min.css) and add it to your project like so:

```
<link rel='stylesheet' href='path/to/default-stylesheet.min.css'>
```
